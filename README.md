# Election_Analysis
## **Overview Of Election Audit**
The election commission had inquired about additional data to complete the previous audit. The goal was to present the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout. We are using data from a CSV election results file, where we will create code in order further analyze the data set for the election commission.

## **Election-Audit Summary**
In using this code specially curated for the election commission, we are able to easily visualize the intensive data set provided. Though, with a few modifications, this script can be used for any election, big or small. The first modification would be to open, read, and write a file for that specific election. And, the second modification would be to add, take away, or change variables considering the results needed for that certain election.
